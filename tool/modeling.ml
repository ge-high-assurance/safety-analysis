(**
   Fault trees should not be constructed manually by typical users. Instead,
   they should be synthesized from libraries of components and
   models. Components are represented with the {i component} type; component
   instances are represented with the {i instance} type; component libraries are
   just a list of components; and models are represented with the {i model}
   type. Here is an example of a library. It is just a list of components.

   {[
   let nasa_handbook_lib =
   [ {name         = "System"; 
      faults       = ["fault"]; 
      input_flows  = ["in"];
      basic_events = ["sys_fl"];
      event_info   = [(1.e-6, 1.)];
      output_flows = ["out"];
      formulas     = [(["out"; "fault"], Or [F ["sys_fl"]; F ["in"; "fault"]])] }];; 
   ]}

   Here is an example of a model. It is a list of component instances along with
   connection information and the identification of a top-level fault.

   {[
   let nasa_handbook_model =
   { instances =  [ makeInstance "Orbiter" "System" ();
                    makeInstance "Main Engine" "System" (); ];
   connections =  [ (("Orbiter", "in"), ("Main Engine", "out"));
                    (("Main Engine", "in"), ("Orbiter", "out")); ];
   top_fault =("Orbiter", F["out"; "fault"]) } ;;
   ]}
