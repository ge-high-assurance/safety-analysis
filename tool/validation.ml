Validation checks are provided to assist the end-user in building component library and models created following the modeling constructs defined for fault tree. Checks include those for the component library only, for the model only, and for the model relative to the library.

Validation checks for component library only:

   - {b checkLibrary_nonEmptyFaults} : All components must support at least one flow, otherwise there is nothing to analyze.

   - {b checkLibrary_componentUnique} : A library of components is a list of components, such that no two components have the same name.

   - {b checkLibrary_formulasMakeSense} : Check that the formulas make sense. 
   
   - {b checkLibrary_disjointInputFlowsandBasicEvents} : Check that the names used for input flows, and basic events are disjoint.
   
   - {b checkLibrary_allOutputFaultsHaveFormulas} : All flows have a formula defined.
   
   - {b checkLibrary_listsAreConsistentLengths} : Check that the lists are all of consistent lengths.

Validation checks for component model only:

   - {b checkModel_inputFlowUnique} : Check that input flows have exactly 1 instance connected to them.
   
   - {b checkModel_instanceNameUnique} : All instance names are disjoint.
   
Validation checks for component model relative to a library:

   - {b checkModel_validConnections} : The connection information is a list of pairs consisting of an input flow and an instance.
   
   - {b checkModel_cnameInstanceIsDefinedInLibrary} : All c_names correspond to actual components in our component library.
   
   - {b checkModel_exposureOfBasicIsDefinedInLibrary} : Elements of the form (a, x) in exposures of an instance make sense.
